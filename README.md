# DEMO: trial of a blockquote w/in a list ‚¨© untrammeled-penny

While attempting routine documentation in Markdown, several **edge cases** presented themselves. In essence, this ‚ÄúREADME.md‚Äù file is faux or trial README, using some of the encountered edge-cases, namely: **Nesting a blockquote** w/in list element; **Nesting a list** w/in blockquote element; Deploying footnotes (understanding footnotes, while simply starting to make use of them!); Strikethrough; Old style title line (?).

It‚Äôs designed to be easy to read and understand and can be used in conjunction with other programming languages due to its flexibility and accessibility.[^1]

## Troubleshooting

### Bugs, Tips & Quirks

MacDown shows odd, non-conforming, and unexpected output compared to Marked2, for example.

- ~~Footnotes are broken down into text, followed by a numbered list. However, nubmbered holds no content.~~  [EDIT: üß∞ Fixed!! Add space between colon and text (at the extended footnote.)]
- SEE: Notes section (following) for breakdown of today‚Äôs problematic encounters (almost entirely resolved.)
    - MacDown continues to render nested blockquotes unpredictably (post woohoo.) However, after employing GitHub edit/preview feature, I feel confident with the final sample‚Äôs syntax.

### Notes: WILT Summary

The tremendous and varied Markdown implementations in the field should be made clear. This led to confusion and frustration as I started, particularly in testing new ideas. The inconsistent rendering left me feeling helpless and stopped my ability to absorb even the basics of what otherwise should be a streamlined, get-to-work language. 

After research and due diligence, I see CommonMark and GitHub flavored[^4] as essential and widely used implementations. CommonMark seemed intent on a consortium to determine standards, led by a top-flight corps of volunteer engineers, ranging from the cream of Stack Overflow/Exchange to GitHub, Pandoc, Reddit, et al. However, their last ‚ÄúSpec‚Äù seems to have been developed two years ago, in 2021, and none has been formally published afaik.[^5] ‚ÄºÔ∏è MultiMark is yet another seemingly **important Markdown branch** I should document.

I enjoy using MacDown Editor with Marked2 parser/renderer/previewer (oy!), plus Zettlr for organizing attribuion. However, each new Markdwon concept, particularly newer elements, was generating confusion‚Äînot understanding if inconsistencies or unexpected behavior was due to user error (me) or differences in parsing engine or settings, on and on. The helpful (and excellent) tool, Babelmark 3[^6] by Alexandre Mutel [^7], renders a comparison of over 250+ (‚ÄºÔ∏è cite?) Markdown ‚Äúconverts servers,‚Äù along with relevant information attached to each run. It is a fantastic tool. Nonetheless, the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù of many instances and a very reasonable 1000-line limit limit the tool for day-to-day production use. 

After much trial and error, I‚Äôve settled on my stash of GitHub repos to demo and test run final `.md` files‚Äîespecially READMEs. I am confident that what renders well on GitHub will conform and render well in most spaces where I want these files to be hosted. In fact, after cleaning up my ‚Äútests‚Äù here on GitHub and pasting them back into my local directories, both MacDown and Marked2 behave beautifully in _EVERY SINGLE edge case!_ üéâ (err, well, most.. woohoo!)

GitHub (for now) is not the ideal space to build a _starter_ developer house. It‚Äôs powerful while streamlined.. and yet daunting (to me, rn). On the other hand, as a repository of `.md` files, GitHub is perfect! I can‚Äôt get into too much trouble posting READMEs üò≥. I‚Äôm excited to start my coding journey, knowing I have a safe place to test and host documentation‚Äìthe lifeblood of the student.

### Endnotes

[^1]: NOTE: The syntax sample for **nesting a blockquote** w/in a list does not render well in **MacDown‚Äôs** parsed preview. The best I can achieve is to add two spaces after parent bullet item, which will indent the child blockquote correctly (but with the `>` appearing and lacking blockquote-like style.) I was/am okay with this ‚Äúworkaround‚Äù as MacDown is simply the editor and not a final host for any doc‚ÄîMarked2 mirrors GitHub‚Äôs output correctly. ~~However, the two extra spaces will fail after a copy/paste from GitHub‚Äôs editor, as extra white space gets stripped out after a commit.~~ (I am wrong about GitHub stripping white space‚ÄîGH utilizes double spaces at the end of sentences as a syntax element. But MacDown rendering still is a bug, IMO) ~~I want to report this as a bug to MacDown and see the response.~~ --This too may be an error as many parsers render similarly, per Babel 3, Aug 2023. GitHub's site renders currently scripted syntax as correct for the purpose‚ÄîI don't understand why Markdown's preview is't matching it.
